## About

Cub3D is a project that demonstrates the basics of 3D rendering using raycasting techniques. The project is being developed as part of a learning process and is inspired by early 3D games. The primary goal is to understand and implement core concepts of 3D graphics and game development.

## Features

- Raycasting engine to simulate 3D perspective
- Basic movement and collision detection
- Simple texture mapping

*Note: The project is still in development, and additional features will be added over time.*
